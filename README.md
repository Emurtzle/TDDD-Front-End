# Tax Due Date Database
Many programs used by accountants to track their client data are targetted towards large scale companies. That can make it expensive for small accounting businesses to use them as they don't have as large of a client base and don't need a ton of features.

Tax Due Date Database (wip) is an online service for small accounting businesses (0 - ~3000 clients) to make tracking their client data and deadlines in a simple and efficient manner.

## Version 1 - Hosted on Heroku
Very much a prototype / proof of concept, the majority of the funtionality of the prototype comes from the table of clients page.

Version 2 of TDDD is currently under development, it is being made without Material UI, and will be hosted on AWS with a database hosted on AWS and will be made a real service.

## Version 3 - (stretch goal)
